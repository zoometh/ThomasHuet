I'm an archaeologist deeply involved in quantitative archaeology. According to me ***there is a natural history of human societies***, so I am quite interested by social sciences, statistics, pattern recognition and data visualization.

# Curriculum Vitae

There is my [CV](https://github.com/zoometh/thomashuet.github.io/blob/main/cv/cv_english.pdf)

# Archaeological researches

I have participate to various projects where a certain degree of formalism was expected to identify reccurent and significative patterns

## Rock-art

My PhD (2012) was dedicated to the mont Bego rock-art (Alpes-Maritimes, France), one of the major concentration in Western Europe with near to 4,000 engraved rocks and 20,000 figurative engravings.



My PhD has been published in the [*Mémoires de la Société Préhistorique Française (n° 63)*](http://www.prehistoire.org/shop_515-40342-0-0/m63-2017-les-gravures-piquetees-du-mont-bego-alpes-maritimes-organisation-spatiale-et-seriation-vie-iie-millenaire-av.-j.-c.-t.-huet.html) in 2017

I started to develop the **[Bego app]("https://zoometh.github.io/bego/")** to allow the general public to prepare a visit to the site.

# IT development

I am used to programm in R and Python, also using markup languages (LaTeX, HTML, etc.), the GitHub platform, GIS and database. I am also familiar with network analysis, shape analysis and 3D/photogrammetry

## Interactive web apps

I've developed **3** RShiny apps based on [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/):

```{r Rshiny.apps}
shiny.apps.df <- data.frame(name=c("EUROEVOL_R",
                                "NeoNet",
                                "Bego"),
                         topic=c("Radiocarbon mapping",
                                 "Radiocarbon mapping",
                                 "Rock-art mapping"),
                         web.url=c("https://zoometh.github.io/C14/",
                                   "https://zoometh.github.io/C14/neonet",
                                   "https://zoometh.github.io/bego/"),
                         app.url=c("https://neolithic.shinyapps.io/Euroevol_R/",
                                   "https://neolithic.shinyapps.io/NeoNet/",
                                   "None"))
kable(shiny.apps.df,"html") %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "center", font_size=12)
```


## The **iconr** R package

I am developping of a R package with [Jose Pozo](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0759-3510) and [Craig Alexander](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Craig_Alexander2). This package has the working name of 'decorr' (soon: 'iconr'). Its purpose is to:

1. map an iconographical content with a relative neighborhood graphs (RNG) created in a GIS
2. compare iconographical composition based on quantitative indices coming from Graph theory (degrees, betweeness, etc.) and spatial analysis (average heights, etc.)
