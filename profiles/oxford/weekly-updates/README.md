- developping a workflow integrating Python, Jupyter NB, GitHub and Google Colab to:
    - ERMS assessement (almost done)
    - citation of the DB (up to come)
- had feedback from my friend (Clément) about the AI/ML concept note (*resumed here*): 
    - intelligent use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and shows promise for preliminary database exploration
    - but:
        - it heavily relies on "prompting," requiring operators to communicate effectively with LLMs. Paradoxically, this solution targets those who may not be skilled in querying databases, yet effective prompting is a skill possessed by those who are familiar with LLMs. Training in prompting may be necessary to address this issue.
        - practical use may be limited to English due to the lower effectiveness of LLMs in languages other than English. This may result in more iterations or increased ambiguity.
        - depth of the solution. Whitout feedback it is hard to say but: accumulating layers of abstraction can possibly lower access to "complete" and precise results.

    - *Arches & Coffee* meeting 
    - Biometric visa

- working with Bijan on a seminal data paper, for a dataset located in Sistan, to showcase the publication data into the DB
- working on interoperability between several Arches-based project (MAPSS, MAHSA, MAEASaM, etc.), see the [BHDC presentation](https://colab.research.google.com/github/achp-project/cultural-heritage/blob/main/presentation/bhdc/rm_compar.ipynb)
- reviewed a concept note on deploying a ML/AI Large Language Models (LLMs) for the DB exploration
    - pros: intelligent use of LLMs
    - cons:
        - it heavily relies on "prompting," requiring operators to communicate effectively with LLMs. Paradoxically, this solution targets those who may not be skilled in querying databases, yet effective prompting is a skill possessed by those who are familiar with LLMs. Training in prompting may be necessary to address this issue.
        - practical use may be limited to English due to the lower effectiveness of LLMs in languages other than English. This may result in more iterations or increased ambiguity.
        - depth of the solution. Whitout feedback it is hard to say but: accumulating layers of abstraction can possibly lower access to "complete" and precise results.
